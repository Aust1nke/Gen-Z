        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>Gen Z graduates are among the most educated, yet they face unprecedented challenges in securing jobs. Factors such as lack of professionalism, disrupted learning during the pandemic, and unrealistic expectations from employers are just some of the key barriers.</p>

        <h3>1. Perceived Lack of Professionalism</h3>
        <p>Many employers find that Gen Z candidates lack basic workplace etiquette. For example, some have shown up for virtual interviews in casual settings or avoided turning on their cameras. <a href="https://www.voanews.com" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

        <h3>2. Pandemic Disruptions</h3>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic deprived Gen Z of critical networking and internship opportunities, leaving them less prepared for workplace challenges. <a href="https://www.voanews.com" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

        <h3>3. Unrealistic Expectations</h3>
